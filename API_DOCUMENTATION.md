# API Documentation

This document summarizes the available endpoints in the Backend NestJS Experiments project and how to view interactive Swagger (OpenAPI) docs.

## How to view interactive docs

The project exposes Swagger UI at:

  http://<host>:<port>/api/docs

Defaults:
- host: `localhost` (or the container hostname)
- port: `3000` (or the value from `PORT` / `process.env.PORT`)

Examples:
- Running locally: `http://localhost:3000/api/docs`
- Running in Docker Compose (app mapped to 3000): `http://localhost:3000/api/docs`


## Endpoints

### GET /
- Description: Health / hello endpoint
- Path: `/`
- Method: `GET`
- Response: `200 OK` with a string message (from `AppService.getHello`).

### POST /users/register
- Description: Create a new user
- Path: `/users/register`
- Method: `POST`
- Body (JSON):
  - `email` (string, required)
  - `password` (string, required)
- Response: created user object (depends on `UserService.create` implementation)

### POST /auth/login
- Description: Login and obtain a JWT token
- Path: `/auth/login`
- Method: `POST`
- Body (JSON):
  - `email` (string, required)
  - `password` (string, required)
- Response: Typically an object with an `access_token` string (depends on `AuthService.login` implementation)


## DTOs
- `CreateUserDto` / `LoginUserDto`: see `src/user/user.dto.ts` for exact properties and validation rules.


## Notes and tips
- Swagger automatically documents routes and DTOs when you annotate controllers, DTOs, and use the Swagger decorators from `@nestjs/swagger`. Current documentation shows the available endpoints in a basic form because controllers and DTOs are not decorated with Swagger decorators yet.

- To improve generated docs, annotate DTO fields with `@ApiProperty()` from `@nestjs/swagger` and add tags or descriptions on controllers and methods.

- When running the DB in Docker and app locally, ensure your `.env` points `DB_HOST` to `127.0.0.1` and the database port is mapped (see `docker-compose.yml`). When running both app and DB in Docker Compose, `DB_HOST` should be set to `db` (service name).


## Next improvements (suggested)
- Add `@ApiTags()` and `@ApiOperation()` decorators to controllers and routes.
- Decorate DTO properties with `@ApiProperty()` for richer schema in Swagger UI.
- Add authentication guard to Swagger (the Swagger setup already includes `addBearerAuth()` but you may want to mark protected routes accordingly).
